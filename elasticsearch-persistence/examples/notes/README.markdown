Demo Aplication for the Repository Pattern
==========================================

This directory contains a simple demo application for the repository pattern of the `Elasticsearch::Persistence`
module in the [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com) framework.

To run the application, first install the required gems and start the application:

```
bundle install
bundle exec ruby application.rb
```

The application demonstrates:

* How to use a plain old Ruby object (PORO) as the domain model
* How to set up, configure and use the repository instance
* How to use the repository in tests
