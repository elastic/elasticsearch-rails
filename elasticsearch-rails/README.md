# Elasticsearch::Rails

The `elasticsearch-rails` library is a companion for the
the [`elasticsearch-model`](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-rails/tree/master/elasticsearch-model)
library, providing features suitable for Ruby on Rails applications.

## Compatibility

This library is compatible with Ruby 1.9.3 and higher.

The library version numbers follow the Elasticsearch major versions, and the `master` branch
is compatible with the Elasticsearch `master` branch, therefore, with the next major version.

| Rubygem       |   | Elasticsearch |
|:-------------:|:-:| :-----------: |
| 0.1           | → | 1.x           |
| 2.x           | → | 2.x           |
| 5.x           | → | 5.x           |
| master        | → | master        |

## Installation

Install the package from [Rubygems](https://rubygems.org):

    gem install elasticsearch-rails

To use an unreleased version, either add it to your `Gemfile` for [Bundler](http://bundler.io):

    gem 'elasticsearch-rails', git: 'git://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-rails.git', branch: '5.x'

or install it from a source code checkout:

    git clone https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-rails.git
    cd elasticsearch-rails/elasticsearch-rails
    bundle install
    rake install

## Features

### Rake Tasks

To facilitate importing data from your models into Elasticsearch, require the task definition in your application,
eg. in the `lib/tasks/elasticsearch.rake` file:

```ruby
require 'elasticsearch/rails/tasks/import'
```

To import the records from your `Article` model, run:

```bash
$ bundle exec rake environment elasticsearch:import:model CLASS='Article'
```

To limit the imported records to a certain
ActiveRecord [scope](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html#scopes),
pass it to the task:

```bash
$ bundle exec rake environment elasticsearch:import:model CLASS='Article' SCOPE='published'
```

Run this command to display usage instructions:

```bash
$ bundle exec rake -D elasticsearch
```

### ActiveSupport Instrumentation

To display information about the search request (duration, search definition) during development,
and to include the information in the Rails log file, require the component in your `application.rb` file:

```ruby
require 'elasticsearch/rails/instrumentation'
```

You should see an output like this in your application log in development environment:

    Article Search (321.3ms) { index: "articles", type: "article", body: { query: ... } }

Also, the total duration of the request to Elasticsearch is displayed in the Rails request breakdown:

    Completed 200 OK in 615ms (Views: 230.9ms | ActiveRecord: 0.0ms | Elasticsearch: 321.3ms)

There's a special component for the [Lograge](https://github.com/roidrage/lograge) logger.
Require the component in your `application.rb` file (and set `config.lograge.enabled`):

```ruby
require 'elasticsearch/rails/lograge'
```

You should see the duration of the request to Elasticsearch as part of each log event:

    method=GET path=/search ... status=200 duration=380.89 view=99.64 db=0.00 es=279.37

### Rails Application Templates

You can generate a fully working example Ruby on Rails application, with an `Article` model and a search form,
to play with (it even downloads _Elasticsearch_ itself, generates the application skeleton and leaves you with
a _Git_ repository to explore the steps and the code) with the
[`01-basic.rb`](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-rails/blob/master/elasticsearch-rails/lib/rails/templates/01-basic.rb) template:

```bash
rails new searchapp --skip --skip-bundle --template https://raw.github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-rails/master/elasticsearch-rails/lib/rails/templates/01-basic.rb
```

Run the same command again, in the same folder, with the
[`02-pretty`](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-rails/blob/master/elasticsearch-rails/lib/rails/templates/02-pretty.rb)
template to add features such as a custom `Article.search` method, result highlighting and
[_Bootstrap_](http://getbootstrap.com) integration:

```bash
rails new searchapp --skip --skip-bundle --template https://raw.github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-rails/master/elasticsearch-rails/lib/rails/templates/02-pretty.rb
```

Run the same command with the [`03-expert.rb`](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-rails/blob/master/elasticsearch-rails/lib/rails/templates/03-expert.rb)
template to refactor the application into a more complex use case,
with couple of hundreds of The New York Times articles as the example content.
The template will extract the Elasticsearch integration into a `Searchable` "concern" module,
define complex mapping, custom serialization, implement faceted navigation and suggestions as a part of
a complex query, and add a _Sidekiq_-based worker for updating the index in the background.

```bash
rails new searchapp --skip --skip-bundle --template https://raw.github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-rails/master/elasticsearch-rails/lib/rails/templates/03-expert.rb
```
