# Elasticsearch

This repository contains various Ruby and Rails integrations for [Elasticsearch](http://elasticsearch.org):

* ActiveModel integration with adapters for ActiveRecord and Mongoid
* _Repository pattern_ based persistence layer for Ruby objects
* _Active Record pattern_ based persistence layer for Ruby models
* Enumerable-based wrapper for search results
* ActiveRecord::Relation-based wrapper for returning search results as records
* Convenience model methods such as `search`, `mapping`, `import`, etc
* Rake tasks for importing the data
* Support for Kaminari and WillPaginate pagination
* Integration with Rails' instrumentation framework
* Templates for generating example Rails application

Elasticsearch client and Ruby API is provided by the
**[elasticsearch-ruby](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-ruby)** project.

## Compatibility

The libraries are compatible with Ruby 1.9.3 and higher.

The version numbers follow the Elasticsearch major versions, and the `master` branch
is compatible with the Elasticsearch `master` branch, therefore, with the next major version.

| Rubygem       |   | Elasticsearch |
|:-------------:|:-:| :-----------: |
| 0.1           | → | 1.x           |
| 2.x           | → | 2.x           |
| 5.x           | → | 5.x           |
| master        | → | master        |

## Installation

Install each library from [Rubygems](https://rubygems.org/gems/elasticsearch):

```ruby
gem install elasticsearch-model
gem install elasticsearch-rails
```

To use an unreleased version, add it to your `Gemfile` for [Bundler](http://bundler.io):

```ruby
gem 'elasticsearch-model', github: 'elastic/elasticsearch-rails', branch: '5.x'
gem 'elasticsearch-rails', github: 'elastic/elasticsearch-rails', branch: '5.x'
```

## Usage

This project is split into three separate gems:

* [**`elasticsearch-model`**](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-rails/tree/master/elasticsearch-model),
  which contains search integration for Ruby/Rails models such as ActiveRecord::Base and Mongoid,

* [**`elasticsearch-persistence`**](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-rails/tree/master/elasticsearch-persistence),
  which provides a standalone persistence layer for Ruby/Rails objects and models

* [**`elasticsearch-rails`**](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-rails/tree/master/elasticsearch-rails),
  which contains various features for Ruby on Rails applications

Example of a basic integration into an ActiveRecord-based model:

```ruby
require 'elasticsearch/model'

class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
  include Elasticsearch::Model
  include Elasticsearch::Model::Callbacks
end

Article.import

@articles = Article.search('foobar').records
```

You can generate a simple Ruby on Rails application with a single command
(see the [other available templates](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-rails/tree/master/elasticsearch-rails#rails-application-templates)):

```bash
rails new searchapp --skip --skip-bundle --template https://raw.github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-rails/master/elasticsearch-rails/lib/rails/templates/01-basic.rb
```

Example of using Elasticsearch as a repository for a Ruby domain object:

```ruby
require 'virtus'
class Article
  include Virtus.model
  attribute :title, String
end

require 'elasticsearch/persistence'
repository = Elasticsearch::Persistence::Repository.new

repository.save Article.new(title: 'Test')
# POST http://localhost:9200/repository/article
# => {"_index"=>"repository", "_type"=>"article", "_id"=>"Ak75E0U9Q96T5Y999_39NA", ...}
```

Example of using Elasticsearch as a persistence layer for a Ruby model:

```ruby
require 'elasticsearch/persistence/model'
class Article
  include Elasticsearch::Persistence::Model
  attribute :title, String, mapping: { analyzer: 'snowball' }
end

Article.create title: 'Test'
# POST http://localhost:9200/articles/article
# => #<Article {title: "Test", id: "lUOQ9lhHToWa7oYPxwjqPQ", ...}>
```

## Development

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/elastic/elasticsearch-rails.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/elastic/elasticsearch-rails) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/elastic/elasticsearch-rails/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/elastic/elasticsearch-rails)

To work on the code, clone the repository and install all dependencies first:

```
git clone https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-rails.git
cd elasticsearch-rails/
bundle install
rake bundle:install
```

### Running the Test Suite

You can run unit and integration tests for each sub-project by running the respective Rake tasks in their folders.

You can also unit, integration, or both tests for all sub-projects from the top-level directory:

    rake test:all

The test suite expects an Elasticsearch cluster running on port 9250, and **will delete all the data**. You can launch an isolated, in-memory Elasticsearch cluster with the following Rake task:

    TEST_CLUSTER_COMMAND=/tmp/builds/elasticsearch-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/bin/elasticsearch TEST_CLUSTER_NODES=1 bundle exec rake test:cluster:start

See more information in the documentation  for the [`elasticsearch-extensions`](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-ruby/tree/master/elasticsearch-extensions#testcluster) gem.
