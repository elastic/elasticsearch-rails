# Elasticsearch

This repository contains ActiveModel, ActiveRecord and Ruby on Rails integrations for
[Elasticsearch](http://elasticsearch.org):

* ActiveModel integration with adapters for ActiveRecord and Mongoid
* Enumerable-based wrapper for search results
* ActiveRecord::Relation-based wrapper for returning search results as records
* Convenience model methods such as `search`, `mapping`, `import`, etc
* Rake tasks for importing the data
* Kaminari and WillPaginate based pagination support
* Integration with Rails's instrumentation framework
* Templates for generating example Rails application

Elasticsearch client and Ruby API is provided by the
**[elasticsearch-ruby](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-ruby)** project.

## Installation

The libraries are compatible with Ruby 1.9.3 and higher.

Install the `elasticsearch-model` and/or `elasticsearch-rails` package from
[Rubygems](https://rubygems.org/gems/elasticsearch):

    gem install elasticsearch-model elasticsearch-rails

To use an unreleased version, either add it to your `Gemfile` for [Bundler](http://gembundler.com):

    gem 'elasticsearch-model', git: 'git://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-rails.git'
    gem 'elasticsearch-rails', git: 'git://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-rails.git'

or install it from a source code checkout:

    git clone https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-rails.git
    cd elasticsearch-model
    bundle install
    rake install
    cd elasticsearch-rails
    bundle install
    rake install

## Usage

This project is split into two separate gems:

* [**`elasticsearch-model`**](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-rails/tree/master/elasticsearch-model),
  which contains model-related features such as setting up indices, `search` method, pagination, etc

* [**`elasticsearch-rails`**](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-rails/tree/master/elasticsearch-rails),
  which contains features for Ruby on Rails applications

Example of a basic integration into an ActiveRecord-based model:

```ruby
require 'elasticsearch/model'

class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
  include Elasticsearch::Model
  include Elasticsearch::Model::Callbacks
end

Article.import

@articles = Article.search('foobar').records
```

You can generate a fully working Ruby on Rails application with a single command:

```bash
rails new searchapp --skip --skip-bundle --template https://raw.github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-rails/master/elasticsearch-rails/lib/rails/templates/01-basic.rb
```

Please refer to each library documentation for detailed information and examples.
